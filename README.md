## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is the most exciting project I've made recently. 

## The process
Dark made is everywhere lately and so I wanted to design something fresh and creative. The layout wasn't to difficult but I had to pay attention to certain microinteractions so that scrolling through is enjoyable. 

## Technologies
Css Grid and Flexbox. No JS in this project.
